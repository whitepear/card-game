- I can click on a card to reveal its face.

- I can then click on a second card to reveal its face.
  If the face matches the face of the first card, both cards are removed from the board.
  If the face does not match the face of the first card, both cards flip over, face-down.

- The game ends when all cards are removed from the board. I can click a button to play again.

- The card placements are randomised each time.
